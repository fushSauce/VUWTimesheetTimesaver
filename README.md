<h4 align="center">
    Copy your calendar events directly into your timesheet.
</h4>

Disclaimer: This userscript isn't affiliated with VUW, I just don't like manually inputting my calendar event details into their timesheet page.

<!-- TODO: Demo gif -->

## Usage

<!-- TODO: Usage -->
Select the events you want to insert from your calendar and copy them, click into the timesheet page and paste the events. The data will be parsed and each event will be added as a row.

## Dependencies

- Browser compatible with Violent Monkey.
- Thunderbird
  - Thunderbird is presently required as it's the only calendar app (that I'm aware of) that lets you select multiple events and copy them as iCal data.

## Installation

Assuming Violent Monkey is being used on a Chromium browser, once file access is given to the extension, just drag `index.user.js` into the browser window and click the install button.
